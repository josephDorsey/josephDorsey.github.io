                Since the light was on in one of the rooms, Anna knew Mara must

                A woman was in court for killing her husband. She said she
                wasn’t guilty and that she dearly missed him. In the closing
                statement, the woman’s lawyer stands up and says, “Her husband
                was just missing. Everyone look at the doors. He’s going to walk
                through them in about 30 seconds.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The entire jury stares at the doors waiting for waiting for this
                woman’s husband to walk through the doors. The lawyer and the
                woman stare at the jury. The lawyer concludes by saying, “See!
                If you were so sure she killed her husband, you wouldn’t be
                watching that door!” The jury immediately gave a guilty verdict.
                Why?

                On the first day of school, someone murdered a history teacher.
                There were four people at the school that the police suspected
                had done it: the landscaper, a math teacher, a basketball coach,
                and the principal. These were their alibis:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The landscaper said he was outside mowing the lawn.</li>

                <li>
                  The basketball coach said he was running practice drills with
                  his players.

                After giving their alibies, the police arrested the killer

                police know?
